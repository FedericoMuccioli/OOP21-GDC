The Base and European roulette wheel have 37 divisions, where numbers from 0 to 36 can be found:
numbers from 1 to 36 are alternately colored red and black, while the single zero is marked in green. 
In American roulette we have in addition a double zero (00) marked green.
The main objective, which any player pursues, is to predict which numbered pocket the roulette ball is going to settle into.
