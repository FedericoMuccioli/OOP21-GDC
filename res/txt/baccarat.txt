The rules of baccarat instead see only two protagonists: the dealer and the player.
In general, the rules of baccarat are rather schematic.
The dealer, after shuffling the decks, deals two cards to the player and two to himself.
At this point the sum of the two cards is calculated: the figures are worth 10, while the 
other cards have their face value.
Only unity should be extrapolated from the sum.
For example, if the cards held by the dealer are for example a 9 and a 6, the result is
9 + 6 = 15 and therefore we consider 5, removing the ten.
If the cards are a 7 and a 3, the result is 10 = 0.
If one of the dealer and the player has a total of 8 or 9 (called baccarat), the hands 
come discoveries and whoever has the highest score wins:
in the case of an identity score, the hand is considered a tie.
If baccarat has not been reached, it proceeds according to other rules.
If the player has rolled a 6 or a 7, he draws no cards.
If, on the other hand, his result is lower, he will receive another card.
At this point it is the dealer's turn, who acts according to the value of his cards:

- If he has totaled 7, he "stands" and does not draw any cards;

- If he has a total of 6, he draws a card if the last player's card is a 6 or a 7;

- If he has a total of 5, he draws a card if the last player's card is 4, 5, 6 or 7;

- If he has a total of 4, he draws a card if the last player's card has a value between 
  2 and 7;

- If he has a total of 3, he draws a card unless the last card of the player is 8 or 9;

- If he has totaled 2, 1 or baccarat, he always draws a card.
